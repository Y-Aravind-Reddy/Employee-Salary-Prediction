# Employee-Salary-Prediction
##ðŸ“˜ Introduction
   
   Purpose: Predict employee salaries using machine learning.
   
   Why: Helps HR in fair salary distribution, planning, and decision-making.
   
   Scope: Uses experience (and other features if available) to predict salary.
   
#ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
  
   Cleaning: Checked for missing or incorrect data.
   
   Encoding: Converted categorical data (if any) to numeric format.
   
   Splitting: Divided data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
   
   Scaling: Normalized features if needed for better model performance.

#ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

   Scatter Plot: Showed clear relation between experience and salary.
   
   Histogram: Checked distribution of salaries.

#ðŸ¤– Model Building and Evaluation

    Algorithm Used: Linear Regression.
    Training: Model was trained on the training dataset.

#Evaluation:


  RÂ² Score: Measures accuracy (closer to 1 = better).
  
  MAE / RMSE: Measures prediction error.
  

#ðŸ“ˆ Results

   Prediction Accuracy: Most predictions were close to actual values.
   
   Visualization: Plotted actual vs. predicted salaries.
   
   Insights: Good model performance, minor errors at extreme values.

#âœ… Conclusion

  Success: Model predicts salary based on experience with good accuracy.
  
  Usefulness: Helps businesses with automated salary estimation.
  
 Improvement: Can include more features like education, job title.
