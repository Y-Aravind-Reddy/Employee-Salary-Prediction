# Employee-Salary-Prediction
##ðŸ“˜ Introduction
   Purpose: Predict employee salaries using machine learning.
   Why: Helps HR in fair salary distribution, planning, and decision-making.
   Scope: Uses experience (and other features if available) to predict salary.
#ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
   Cleaning: Checked for missing or incorrect data.
   Encoding: Converted categorical data (if any) to numeric format.
   Splitting: Divided data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
   Scaling: Normalized features if needed for better model performance.

#ðŸ“Š Data Visualization
   Scatter Plot: Showed clear relation between experience and salary.
   Histogram: Checked distribution of salaries.
   Heatmap: Displayed feature correlation, helping to identify key predictors.

#ðŸ¤– Model Building and Evaluation
    Algorithm Used: Linear Regression.
    Training: Model was trained on the training dataset.

#Evaluation:

  RÂ² Score: Measures accuracy (closer to 1 = better).
  MAE / RMSE: Measures prediction error.

#ðŸ“ˆ Results
   Prediction Accuracy: Most predictions were close to actual values.
   Visualization: Plotted actual vs. predicted salaries.
   Insights: Good model performance, minor errors at extreme values.

#âœ… Conclusion
  Success: Model predicts salary based on experience with good accuracy.
  Usefulness: Helps businesses with automated salary estimation.
 Improvement: Can include more features like education, job title.
